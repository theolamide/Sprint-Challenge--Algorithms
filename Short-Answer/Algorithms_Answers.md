#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n^2) - This is O(n^2) because as n grows is grows as the square of n.
 
b) O(1) - J never really grows. The number of operations never really get off while the condition is met.


c) O(n) - number of operations roughly equals number of elements. It's almost perfectly linear.

## Exercise II
